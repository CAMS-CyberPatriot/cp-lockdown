Guides for locking down a computer

You can read up a guide for a specific operating system. For example, open
win7.html for Windows 7.

The guides are put together from multiple .html files. This should make it
easier to update information as needed. The source files for the guides are in
the /res directory. The create.py is a Python script to recreate the .html
guide files. This only needs to be done if the /res files are edited.
